						<h2>Aim: Getting connected</h2>
						<p>The overall aim of the EfficienSea2 project is to create and implement innovative and smart solutions for efficient, safe and sustainable traffic at sea through improved connectivity for ships.</p>
						<p>Today, information exchange between ships and shore is unstable, costly and marked by old technology and non-standardised solutions. This increases the risk of accidents, inefficiency and administrative burdens. Also, incentives to comply with emission regulations are limited, which adversely impacts the environment. The<br /> need for operational solutions in the maritime domain is significant.</p>
						<p>EfficienSea2 develops the essential solutions that are the prerequisites for taking e-Navigation from testbeds<br /> to real-life implementation.</p>
